# Importado

This is a little application to calculate the import fees in Switzerland. 
Which is always a mess to calculate. There are two fees to pay: [Post](https://www.post.ch/en/business/a-z-of-subjects/customs-clearance-and-import-regulations/importing-and-receiving-consignments/faqs-about-imports-customs-and-vat) and [Customs](https://www.ezv.admin.ch/ezv/en/home/information-individuals/online-shopping--mail-and-courier-consignments/onlineshopping--sample-calculation---taxable-goods-value.html), and they're depending on different variables. This was the reason I built this application. It was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.0.
